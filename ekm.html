                    The flooring of the palace is a sight to behold, as because it looks like polished black marble, but has been made the traditional Kerala way using burnt coconut shells, lime, charcoal, egg white etc giving a lasting finish. The reputation of the Palace is in the various murals painted in warm and rich colours the tempura style.</p>

                    This unique way of fishing was introduced by the Chinese traders in the 14th century extending its relevance to “Ko-chi”, meaning China like. Sunsets across the backwaters, rivers or sea offer a panoramic splendour of the skyline with silhouettes of Chinese fishing nets in the backdrop.</p>
