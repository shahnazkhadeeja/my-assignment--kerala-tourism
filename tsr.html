                  <p class="card-text">On the outskirts of the city at a distance of some 60 km, the Athirappilly waterfalls mark one of the best places to visit in Thrissur. Standing 80 ft tall and about 330 ft wide, these falls are the largest in the state of Kerala.

                    The majesty of this place can be understood by the fact that the falls are located on the Chalakudy River, that originates from the highest mountain in India outside of the Himalayas. A perfect place for a group outing, these falls are sometimes called the Niagra of India

                  <p class="card-text">Another gem on the Chalakudy River in the Athirappilly region of Kerala, the falls are located between two major tourist spots in the region; Athirappilly Falls and Vazhachal Falls. Not just that, the falls are also a midway stop for a number of tourists who are visiting the above falls.

                    The flow of the water on the rocks is as such that the water looks like milk flowing, further adding to the charm of this place. The waterfall is best visited in the months right after the monsoon season when the water spills onto the road nearby.</p>
